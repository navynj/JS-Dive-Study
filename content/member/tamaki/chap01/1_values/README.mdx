# Study Note
  - What is a value in JavaScript?
  A value in JavaScript is a piece of data that can be stored in a variable, returned from a function, or passed around in a program. 

  - How do values represent data in your program?
  Values in JavaScript represent data by being stored in variables and manipulated through operations. There are two main types of values:
  Primitive values (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans) are immutable and stored directly in memory.
  Reference values (e.g., objects, arrays) are mutable and stored as references in memory.


  - The seven primitive types in JavaScript
  Number,String,Boolean,Undefined,Null,Symbol,BigInt
  Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used for object properties.
  BigInt: Represents large integers beyond Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

  - Characteristics of primitive types with examples (e.g., immutability).
  let str = "hello";
  str.toUpperCase(); // Returns "HELLO", but `str` remains "hello"
  console.log(str); // "hello"
    

  - What are reference types, and how do they differ from primitives?
  Reference types are objects, arrays, and functions. Unlike primitive types, which store values directly, reference types store a reference (memory address) to the value.

  - Concepts of mutability and immutability.
  Mutable values can be modified after creation (e.g., objects, arrays).
  Immutable values cannot be changed once created (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans).

  - The difference between shallow and deep copies.
  Shallow Copy: Copies only the first-level properties; nested objects remain referenced.
  Deep Copy: Creates a fully independent copy, including nested structures.

  - Operators (+, -, *, /, %)
  Addition (+): Adds two numbers or concatenates strings.
  Subtraction (-): Subtracts numbers.
  Multiplication (*): Multiplies numbers.
  Division (/): Divides numbers.
  Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of division.
  
  - Logical Operators
  AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
  OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
  NOT (!): Inverts a boolean value.
  
  - The difference between '==' and '==='
  == (Loose equality): Performs type coercion before comparing.
  === (Strict equality): Compares both value and type.
  
  - The difference between implicit and explicit type coercion.
  Implicit Type Coercion: JavaScript automatically converts types.
  Explicit Type Coercion: Conversion is done manually using functions.
  
  - How type coercion works in operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison.
  ・Addition (+)
  If one operand is a string, the other is converted to a string.
  ・Subtraction (-)
  Converts both operands to numbers.
  ・Comparison (==)
  Converts types to compare values.
