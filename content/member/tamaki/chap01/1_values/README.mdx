# Study Note
### **What is a value in JavaScript?**
  A value in JavaScript is a piece of data that can be stored in a variable, returned from a function, or passed around in a program. 
<br />

### **How do values represent data in your program?**
  Values in JavaScript represent data by being stored in variables and manipulated through operations. There are two main types of values:
  - Primitive values (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans) are immutable and stored directly in memory.
  - Reference values (e.g., objects, arrays) are mutable and stored as references in memory.

<br />

### **The seven primitive types in JavaScript**
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Undefined
  - Null
  - Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used for object properties.
  - BigInt: Represents large integers beyond Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

<br />

### **Characteristics of primitive types with examples (e.g., immutability).**
  ```javscript
  let str = "hello";
  str.toUpperCase(); // Returns "HELLO", but `str` remains "hello"
  console.log(str); // "hello"
  ```
<br />

### **What are reference types, and how do they differ from primitives?**
  Reference types are objects, arrays, and functions. Unlike primitive types, which store values directly, reference types store a reference (memory address) to the value.
<br />

### **Concepts of mutability and immutability.**
  Mutable values can be modified after creation (e.g., objects, arrays).
  Immutable values cannot be changed once created (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans).
<br />

### **The difference between shallow and deep copies.**
  Shallow Copy: Copies only the first##level properties; nested objects remain referenced.
  Deep Copy: Creates a fully independent copy, including nested structures.
<br />

### **Operators (+, -, *, /, %)**
  - Addition (+): Adds two numbers or concatenates strings.
  - Subtraction (-): Subtracts numbers.
  - Multiplication (*): Multiplies numbers.
  - Division (/): Divides numbers.
  - Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of division.

<br />

### **Logical Operators**
  - AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
  - OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
  - NOT (!): Inverts a boolean value.

<br />

### **The difference between '==' and '==='**
  - == (Loose equality): Performs type coercion before comparing.<br/>
  - === (Strict equality): Compares both value and type.

<br />

### **The difference between implicit and explicit type coercion.**
  - Implicit Type Coercion: JavaScript automatically converts types.
  - Explicit Type Coercion: Conversion is done manually using functions.

<br />

### **How type coercion works in operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison.**
  - Addition (+)<br />
  If one operand is a string, the other is converted to a string.
  - Subtraction (-)<br />
  Converts both operands to numbers.
  - Comparison (==)<br />
  Converts types to compare values.
